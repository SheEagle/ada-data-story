            <h2 class="rq-title">Take a Look at Reddit’s Galaxy</h2>
        </div>

        <p>Welcome to the Reddit Galaxy. In this vast digital expanse, every <strong>Subreddit</strong> acts as a unique
            planet. These worlds do not exist in isolation; they are tethered by "gravitational bridges"—hyperlinks that
            allow information and users to travel from one corner of the universe to another. To understand this cosmos,
            we first calibrated our instruments to capture the basic signals of inter-community interaction.</p>


        <p>Our initial scan revealed two distinct frequencies of communication: <strong>Title</strong> and
            <strong>Body</strong> mentions. The Title frequency is significantly more active, generating approximately
            572,000 links across 54,075 unique planets—nearly double the volume and 1.5 times the variety found in Body
            mentions (287,000 links). Interestingly, these two frequencies never overlap; every signal is a unique
            star-bridge, suggesting that most interstellar dialogue begins with a high-impact "broadcast" in the title
            rather than within the deeper "crust" of the post body.</p>

        <p>As we tracked this galaxy over a 2.5-year period (2014–2017), we observed a steady, linear expansion ($R^2 =
            0.87$). This is not a chaotic growth, but a rhythmic pulse. Perhaps most encouragingly, the "spectral
            analysis" of these links shows a galaxy dominated by light: <strong>Positive sentiment</strong> links
            outnumber negative ones by a staggering <strong>8.35 to 1</strong>. Furthermore, positive connections are
            expanding at a much faster rate (slope 2.39) than negative ones (slope 0.24), indicating that as the Reddit
            Galaxy grows, it is becoming increasingly defined by constructive alignment rather than friction.</p>

        <p>Zooming out to view the entire topological map, we identified <strong>67,180 planets</strong> interconnected
            by <strong>339,643 bridges</strong>. On average, each planet maintains roughly 10 gravitational ties to
            others, creating a densely populated social space. However, the connectivity is not uniform. We discovered a
            <strong>"Great Super-cluster"</strong>—a massive, weakly connected structure encompassing over 97% (65,648)
            of all known planets. Outside this main civilization, about 711 tiny "Islands" float in deep space,
            consisting of only a handful of planets that remain disconnected from the galactic hub.</p>

        <p>This directed network reveals a clear hierarchy: while the galaxy is physically massive and largely
            reachable, the flow of influence is often one-way. This directional gravity shapes how information cascades
            through the system, moving from influential "super-giants" to the peripheral settlements of the outer
            rim.</p>

            <span class="rq-label">Research Question 01</span>
            <h2 class="rq-title">Based on community social attributes, what distinct communication patterns can we
                define?</h2>
        </div>

        <p>When we first approached Reddit as a data “galaxy” of this scale, the most intuitive strategy was
            straightforward: to examine what these individual “planets” (subreddits) were talking about. We began with a
            set of content-based embedding vectors representing each community, which functioned much like a resource
            map—highlighting where discussions of technology, entertainment, or shared topical interests were
            concentrated.</p>

        <p>However, it quickly became clear that a purely content-driven perspective was insufficient. Two communities
            that frequently discuss “Bitcoin” are not necessarily close in any meaningful social sense: one may be a
            long-standing supporter community, while the other exists primarily to criticize or mock it. Treating them
            as neighbors solely on the basis of shared vocabulary obscures the more consequential social structure
            beneath. Content captures what communities talk about, but it offers limited insight into whom they align
            with.</p>

        <p>For this reason, we shifted our focus away from the content map and toward a more fundamental layer of the
            system: the hyperlink structure connecting communities. Each citation, cross-post, or reference represents a
            point of contact between subreddits—whether as endorsement, borrowing, critique, or confrontation. Using
            these links, we constructed an inter-community network and applied the Leiden clustering algorithm to
            identify cohesive “constellations” within it. Compared to traditional classification methods, Leiden is
            particularly effective at detecting groups that are structurally dense and interactionally cohesive, making
            these constellations a closer approximation of Reddit’s operative social topology.</p>

        <p>Once this structural star map was established, a new challenge emerged: how to characterize the “social
            distance” between communities. A binary distinction between interactions occurring within the same
            constellation and those crossing constellation boundaries proved too coarse, as it could not account for why
            some cross-community exchanges remain measured and constructive while others escalate rapidly into
            hostility.</p>

        <p>To address this, we further partitioned all interactions into four categories, which form the analytical
            foundation of our subsequent analyses. Intra-Core interactions occur between the most tightly connected
            communities within a constellation; these communities share a highly aligned discourse and normative
            framework, and their exchanges tend to be more nuanced and internally coherent. Intra-Periphery interactions
            also take place within the same constellation but involve more peripheral communities, where shared cultural
            background exists alongside weaker ties, often creating conditions for internal friction.
            Beyond constellation boundaries, we distinguish Cross-Strong interactions, which connect communities from
            different constellations that nonetheless maintain stable, recurrent exchanges, typically supported by a
            partial shared context. Finally, Cross-Weak interactions occur between communities with little or no prior
            relationship, representing the greatest social distance and the highest likelihood of contextual mismatch
            and emotionally charged communication.</p>

        <p>The purpose of this four-way classification is not to introduce additional labels, but to more precisely
            examine how language and conflict vary with social distance. </p>

            <h2 class="rq-title">Does linguistic complexity decrease when users engage with hostile out-groups?</h2>
        </div>

        <p>When we analyzed the complexity of language used between different groups, a striking pattern emerged. We
            discovered that as communities engage with "outsiders," their language shifts dramatically.</p>

        <p>This phenomenon, which we call "Tactical Simplicity," suggests that complex jargon is reserved for the
            in-group, while simple, aggressive language is weaponized for the out-group.</p>
