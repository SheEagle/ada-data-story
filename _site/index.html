        </div>

        <p>Welcome to the Galaxy of Reddit. In this vast digital expanse, every planet is called a
            <strong>Subreddit</strong>
            pooling together likeminded thinkers from across the galaxy. These planets do not exist in isolation.
            They are socially connected through their inhabitants, called <strong>users</strong> constantly debating.
            These users are complete information haulers, during theyr visits to other planets they send reports to
            theyr current home planet <strong>mentioning</strong> things that caught theyr attention. And these reports
            can be
            quite emotional having positive/neutral or negative outlook on things. In other words having different
            <strong>sentiment</strong>.
            This inborn behaviour alows information flow across the galaxy and socialy <strong>links</strong> planets
            closer togehter.
            We, the geeky inhabitants of planet EPFL, are fascinated by these referential migration patterns and want to
            understand how information spreads through this galaxy. To observe
            them, we calibrated our instruments to spy on these traveling user reports. (This involves no privacy
            breach. In this universe, all reports are anonymous unless users deliberately reveal their identities).

        <p> Our initial scan revealed two distinct styles of user reports. Some users are careful, embedding the planets
            names deep within the <strong>body</strong> of their report. Others are careless, broadcasting the planet
            they are talking about in the <strong>title</strong> for all to see. Since tracking all the reports is over
            our limits, we called
            for help from a scholarly planet known as Stanford, which provided historical Galaxy report records from
            2014 to 2017 from what they call the <strong>Reddit Hyperlink Network</strong> program.
            Using analytical tools granted by the galaxy’s overseers, ADA, we explored these traveling reports and
            uncovered unexpected and sometimes unsettling information pathways.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>This is the story of how we became the Variance Vanguards of the subreddit galaxy.</strong>

        <p><em>To keep both explorers and scientists satisfied, we switch to precise terminology
            for the analysis that follows, returning to the narrative when interpreting what we observe in cursive.</em>


        <h2 class="rq-title">An Expanding Reddit Universe</h2>


        <p> Over a 2.5-year period Reddit Hyperlink Network dataset tracks we managed to observe approximately
            860 000 mentions, with title citations taking two thirds of total links totaling 572 000 across 54 075
            unique subredits.
            In this 2.5-year period weekly posts mentioning other subredits grew in a steady pace with growth
            following a strong linear trend (<em>R</em><sup>2</sup> = 0.87) (Figure <a href="#linear_exp">0.1</a>),
            most of the observed growth being positive or neutral sentiment mentions. With positive/neutral sentiment
            outnumbering
            the negative by 8.35 to 1. Furthermore, linear regression reveals a substantially steeper growth rate for
            positive and
            neutral mentions (slope = 2.39) than for negative mentions (slope = 0.24) (Figure <a
                    href="#sentiment_slope">0.2</a>).

        <p> Connectivity across Reddit is highly uneven and does not reach all nodes. Most subreddits belong to one
            large
            weakly connected cluster of 65 648 nodes, while 711 smaller clusters remain isolated from the main graph.
            However, strong connectivity is much more limited. Only 21 432 nodes form a single strongly connected
            cluster, leaving
            45 563 nodes weakly attached through mostly one-way connections.

        <p><em>After a short warm-up with the data, reality sets in. This universe is big and not complitely wired. A
            few crowded planets
            constantly receive reports about each other, while many others gets explored less. Large parts of the galaxy
            are not talked about.

                define?</h2>
        </div>

        <p>
            At the early stage of exploring Reddit as a large-scale data galaxy, we initially wanted to perform a
            clustering on subreddits based on embeddings on user overlap, assuming that if
            two “planets” (subreddits) shared a substantial number of active users, they should naturally appear close
            to each other on the social map.

            This assumption, however, quickly revealed two critical technical limitations.
        </p>

        <ul style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
            <li><strong>Structural Isolation:</strong> User overlap reflects shared interests rather than actual
                interaction. Many communities share a large user base yet rarely engage with one another structurally,
                which artificially pulls together what are effectively parallel worlds.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Sparsity &amp; Incompleteness:</strong> This embedding approach covers only a subset of
                communities, leaving large portions of the ecosystem unmapped.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This realization led us to shift focus from surface-level content similarity to a deeper structural layer:
            the <strong>hyperlink-based interaction network</strong>.
            Each mention in a link represents a concrete point of contact between communities.
            By modeling these links, we wish to construct an inter-community network and identified clusters within it.
            Each cluster is treated as a <strong>“star cluster”</strong>: a group of communities with closely aligned
            norms, topics, and interaction patterns.

            Algorithmic Competition: Identifying the Optimal Gravitational Field
        </h3>

        <p>
            To partition tens of thousands of communities into coherent and analytically meaningful structures, we
            subjected three widely used community detection algorithms to a systematic stress test. Rather than relying
            on a single metric, we evaluated their performance through three complementary, physically inspired
            indicators that capture different aspects of structural quality within the Reddit galaxy.

        <p>
            While <strong>FastGreedy</strong> achieves the highest modularity score, its optimization favors dense
            internal grouping at the cost of slightly higher boundary leakage. <strong>Infomap</strong>, in contrast,
            fragments the galaxy into over three thousand micro-clusters, producing a structure that is overly granular
            and difficult to interpret at a systemic level.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <strong>Leiden algorithm</strong> offers the most balanced results. With the lowest
            average conductance (0.198), it identifies 85 well-formed clusters that are both cohesive and interpretable,
            while maintaining adequate coverage of overall interactions. This balance between internal coherence and
            boundary clarity makes Leiden the most suitable foundation for modeling the large-scale social structure of
            the Reddit galaxy. Accordingly, we adopt Leiden as the baseline algorithm for defining cluster-level
            dynamics in all subsequent analyses.

        <h3 style="color: var(--accent-purple);">A Two-Stage Classification of Social Distance</h3>

        <p>
            Once this structural map was established, a new challenge emerged:
            how can we precisely describe “social distance” between communities?
            A simple distinction between “within-cluster” and “cross-cluster” interactions is too coarse.
            It cannot explain why some cross-cluster exchanges remain measured and cooperative, while others escalate
            rapidly.
        </p>

        <p>
            To address this, we designed a <strong>two-stage classification framework</strong> that separates
            interactions along two independent dimensions:
            the status of the source community and the intensity of the connection.
        </p>

        <ul style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
            <li>
                <strong>Stage 1: Intra-cluster role differentiation</strong><br>
                Based on centrality within each star cluster, communities are classified as <strong>Core(Top 30%
                active)</strong> or
                <strong>Periphery(The rest 70%)</strong>.
                This distinction captures whether a signal originates from a dominant, well-established position or from
                a more marginal one.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Stage 2: Cross-cluster link strength</strong><br>
                For cross-cluster interactions, we compute the median interaction strength and apply a balanced <strong>50/50
                split</strong>.
                Links above the median are classified as <strong>Strong</strong>, representing stable and recurring
                cross-cluster ties;
                those below the median are labeled <strong>Weak</strong>, reflecting infrequent or incidental contact.

                This “galactic census” shows that Reddit is far from a flat or uniform space.
                Social gravity organizes it into a system <strong>anchored by dense cores and connected by cross-cluster
                bridges</strong>.
                This structural baseline motivates our next question:
                <strong>does a community’s position in the galaxy fundamentally shape how it speaks?</strong>

            <span class="rq-label">Research Question 02</span>
            <h2 class="rq-title">How do the social attributes of communication links determine baseline linguistic
                patterns in a peaceful
                context?</h2>
        </div>

        <p>In the previous stage, we conceptualized Reddit as a galaxy of tens of thousands of communities and
            identified four interaction types: <strong>Intra-Core, Intra-Periphery, Cross-Strong, and
                Cross-Weak</strong>.</p>

        <p>In this section, we move beyond describing the structure itself and ask a more focused question:
            <strong>Once major confounding factors are removed, how does social distance shape language use?</strong>
        </p>

        <p>This question seems straightforward but is methodologically delicate. Raw data cannot directly answer it, as
            they are heavily influenced by covariates. Without proper control, any patterns observed might reflect noise
            rather than genuine effects. The goal here is not simply to “discover patterns” but to systematically
            calibrate the data and determine which linguistic differences are truly driven by social distance.</p>

        <div style="background: rgba(0, 195, 255, 0.1); border-left: 4px solid var(--accent-cyan); padding: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0; border-radius: 4px;">
            <h4 style="color: var(--accent-cyan); margin-top: 0;">📋 Core Terminology</h4>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">To ensure analytical clarity, we divide interaction contexts into two
                categories based on the sentiment of links:</p>
            <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
                <li><strong>Peace:</strong> Interactions classified as <strong>positive</strong> or
                    <strong>neutral</strong>,
                    representing the galaxy’s steady state.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Conflict:</strong> Interactions classified as <strong>negative</strong>,
                    representing periods of instability or disturbance.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>


        <h3 class="sub-glow">First Calibration: Controlling Conflict Rate</h3>
        <p>The first confounding variable is the uneven distribution of conflict across interaction types.</p>
        <p>Conflict is not evenly spread in the Reddit galaxy. Cross-Strong interactions show a much higher frequency of
            antagonistic language than internal community interactions. By contrast, Intra-Core and Intra-Periphery
            interactions are generally more restrained. Analyzing all messages together would allow high-conflict
            language to mask the structural properties of everyday communication.</p>
        <div class="container-wide">
            <div class="chart-wrapper">
                <iframe class="chart-content"
                        src="/ada-data-story/assets/plots/RQ2/conflict_rate_comparison.html"></iframe>
                <div class="chart-caption">
                    FIG 2.1
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>To address this, we divide the corpus into peaceful and conflictual contexts. In this analysis, we focus
            first on the peaceful context, where language choices
            reliably reflect communicative expectations and audience perception.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-glow">Second Calibration: Controlling Source Clusters</h3>
        <p>Even within peaceful interactions, a second confound exists: the Source Cluster.</p>
        <p>Each cluster in the Reddit galaxy consists of communities with similar topics, norms, and stylistic habits.
            These inherent preferences influence language. Some clusters favor long sentences, abstract concepts, and
            extended reasoning; others prefer short, direct, and pragmatic communication. If a specific interaction type
            is dominated by certain clusters, cluster-specific style could be misattributed to social distance.</p>
        <p>To remove this bias, we apply a <strong>Linear Mixed-Effects Model (LMM)</strong>. Each message’s source
            cluster is treated as a random effect, absorbing cluster-level stylistic differences. The remaining fixed
            effects therefore more reliably reflect the influence of interaction type itself. Effectively, the LMM
            allows us to observe language in the Reddit galaxy after subtracting local cultural coloration.</p>

                After both calibrations, we can treat the Reddit galaxy as operating in a stable state. Language now
                reflects social attributes’ structural influence rather than conflict or cluster culture.

                differential linguistic adaptations across distinct link types</h2>
        </div>

        <p>If the Reddit galaxy under peaceful conditions revealed an elegant equilibrium shaped by stable orbits,
            conflict acts as a sudden gravitational disturbance. Using the LMM model on conflict-context data, we
            observed that antagonism does not merely amplify emotions—it fundamentally reshapes the structure of signals
            across the galaxy.</p>

                Having established a stable baseline, we now introduce disturbance. By isolating links classified as
                <strong>negative</strong>, we observe how language shifts when the Reddit galaxy briefly exits
                equilibrium.
                Conflict is rare, but its linguistic signature is sharp.

                <strong>Key Insight:</strong> The LMM calibration confirms that conflict does not erase social traits—it
                amplifies them. Closest clusters fight for identity, the farthest for logic, and peripheral clusters for
                raw emotion. The galaxy’s conflict map reveals a gradient from rational negotiation to unfiltered
                outburst, showing how social distance dictates the form and intensity of conflict in the Reddit galaxy.

            <h2 class="rq-title">Macro Perspective: Steady-State Structures and Conflict-Driven Reorganization in the
                Reddit Galaxy</h2></div>
        <p>So far, we have analyzed communication links at the micro level, examining signal complexity, logic, identity
            markers, and emotional tone. However, a galaxy is not defined by individual signals alone—it is shaped by
            the interplay of stars and clusters. At the macro level, we face a structural question: <strong>What
                fundamentally defines the social architecture of the Reddit galaxy? When conflicts emerge, does this
                architecture remain stable, or does it reorganize?</strong></p>

        <p>Previous analyses were conducted on the <strong>global network</strong>, considering both positive and
            negative interactions together. To test the robustness of the observed structures, we reconstructed the
            galaxy under two extreme observational lenses: one network containing only <strong>positive links</strong>
            (peace network) and another containing only <strong>negative links</strong> (conflict network).</p>

        <p>First, we conducted a short network analysis of these 3 networks.</p>

        <p>The network audit reveals that the **Peace** sub-network serves as the galaxy’s structural anchor, mirroring
            the **Global** skeleton with near-total connectivity (**99.92% LWCC**). In contrast, the **Conflict**
            network behaves like a dense nebula; despite its smaller footprint, its density is nearly four times higher,
            yet it suffers from a sharp drop in reciprocity (**0.0675**) and deeper negative assortativity
            (**-0.1604**). This confirms that while peace facilitates a stable, mutual dialogue that defines the social
            order, conflict manifests as concentrated, one-sided "firepower coverage" that triggers structural drift
            across dissimilar clusters.</p>

                (only negative interactions).
            </li>
            <li>Compute 27 language features for each link, including readability, sentence length, pronoun usage,
                emotional tone, and LIWC categories.
            </li>
            <li>Fit a linear mixed-effects model (LMM) to extract fixed-effect coefficients, producing high-dimensional
                behavior vectors for each link.
            </li>
            <li>Compare peace and conflict contexts using Pearson correlations, Jaccard similarity, and feature drift
                analysis to track structural stability and role shifts.

        <p>This approach allows us to track social structures at the “galaxy scale,” mapping gravitational wells of
            clusters and observing how conflict perturbs or reshapes these orbits.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-glow">1. Initial Hypothesis: “Mirror-Constant” Structures</h3>
        <p>In the exploratory Phase 0, we observed that positive interactions dominate: roughly 8.35 positive links per
            negative one. This led to the following hypothesis:</p>

        <div class="insight-card" style="border-left-color: var(--accent-gold);">
            <p class="insight-text" style="font-size: 1.05rem;">
                We assume that positive interactions define the Reddit galaxy’s “gravitational skeleton,” determining
                which communities occupy the core, which serve as cross-cluster bridges, and which orbit at the
                periphery. Conflicts may induce local turbulence, but the overall skeletal structure should remain
                stable.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="sub-glow">2. Technical Verification: Peace as the Galaxy’s Anchor</h3>
        <p>To test this, we compared the global network with the peace-only network:</p>
        <ul style="line-height:1.8; padding-left:1.2rem;">
            <li>Computed LMM fixed-effect coefficients for each link, resulting in 27-dimensional high-dimensional
                behavior vectors.
            </li>
            <li>Calculated Pearson correlations between corresponding links in the peace and global networks.</li>
            <li>Observed near-perfect alignment: peripheral links (Intra-Periphery) reached correlations up to 0.99,
                with core links similarly aligned.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="chart-wrapper">
            <iframe class="chart-content"
                    src="/ada-data-story/assets/plots/RQ4/feature_isomorphism_peace.html"></iframe>
            <div class="chart-caption">
                Figure 4.4
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>This confirms that positive interactions do not merely dominate in volume—they define the steady-state social
            architecture. <strong>Peace acts as the galaxy’s gravitational anchor</strong>, holding core and peripheral
            clusters in predictable orbits.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-glow">3. Structural Drift: Conflict-Induced Logic Shifts</h3>
        <p>Examining the conflict-only network reveals that the mirror-constant assumption breaks down. Conflict does
            not just amplify existing patterns—it generates a new social gravity, reshaping the galaxy’s landscape.</p>

        <div class="chart-wrapper">
            <iframe class="chart-content"
                    src="/ada-data-story/assets/plots/RQ4/feature_isomorphism_Negative.html"></iframe>

                Figure 4.5
            </div>
        </div>


        <p>Correlations shrink significantly under conflict, with peripheral regions showing the largest divergence.
            This indicates that edge clusters are the first to experience destabilization. <strong>Conflict warps the
                underlying social skeleton</strong>, producing behaviors unseen under steady conditions.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-glow">4. Role Drift & Structural Reorganization</h3>
        <p>To analyze structural reorganization under conflict, we employed a combination of set theory and statistical
            comparison:</p>
        <ul style="line-height:1.8; padding-left:1.2rem;">
            <li><strong>Jaccard Similarity:</strong> Measures the overlap of core members between peace and conflict
                networks, quantifying role retention or migration.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Feature Drift Analysis:</strong> For nodes “relegated” from core to periphery, we track shifts
                in language features (logic, pronouns, emotional tone, readability) before and after migration, testing
                the hypothesis that high traffic does not guarantee structural influence.
            </li>
        </ul>
