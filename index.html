            <h2 class="rq-title">Take a Look at Reddit’s Galaxy</h2>
        </div>

        <p>Welcome to the Galaxy of Reddit - a massive social networking platform, known for its vast communities (subreddits) on discussions, 
            news, expert advice, entertainment (memes, stories), and various niche topics. In Reddit's vast digital expanse, every planet (
            <strong>Subreddit</strong>)
            pools together likeminded thinkers from across the galaxy. These planets do not exist in isolation.
            They are socially connected through their inhabitants, called <strong>users</strong> constantly debating and
            communicating.
            Discussions on Reddit forums can take various forms and encompass all kinds of emotion (positive, negative, angry, appreciative, etc.). 
            When one subreddit references another subreddit (by adding a link to a post/conversation in the target subreddit), there is information
            flow between communities as they interact. Some subreddits interact more frequently than others - making the planets
            knit together closely through social interaction.
            We, the geeky inhabitants of planet r/EPFL, are fascinated by these information exchange patterns and want to
            understand how the linguistic style of communication varies for different links within Reddit's online galaxy. To observe
            them, we calibrated our instruments to spy on these intra-planet links!

        <p> Our initial scan revealed two distinct styles of intra-community links. Some users embed the links to other communities' posts
            deep within the <strong>body</strong> of the post, while others mention it in the <strong>title</strong> itself. 
            Stanford's <strong>Reddit Hyperlink Network</strong> record all such hyperlinks from
            2014 to 2017. Using analytical tools granted by the galaxy’s data analysis overseers, ADA, we explored these hyperlinks and
            uncovered interesting (and sometimes unexpected) information pathways.
            <br>
            <br>



        <h2 class="rq-title">An Expanding the Reddit Universe</h2>


        <p> The Reddit Hyperlink Network dataset (https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-RedditHyperlinks.html) contains approximately
            860 000 hyperlinks from one community to another, over a period of 2.5 years, 
            with title citations forming two thirds of the total 572 000 links across 54 075
            unique subreddits in the dataset.
            In this 2.5-year period, the weekly number of posts with mentioning other subreddits grew in a steady pace,
            following a strong linear trend (<em>R</em><sup>2</sup> = 0.87) (Figure <a href="#linear_exp">0.1</a>),
            most of the posts encompassing positive or neutral sentiment. (The ratio of positive/neutral sentiment
            to negative was 8.35 to 1!)
            
            Furthermore, linear regression reveals a substantially steeper growth rate for
            positive and
            neutral mentions (slope = 2.39) than for negative mentions (slope = 0.24) (Figure <a
                    href="#sentiment_slope">0.2</a>).
        </p>

        <p><em>That’s a nice universe expansion metric! Neutral or positive inter-community exchange is growing 
            faster than its negativity.</em>

        <p> We model the Reddit Hyperlink Network as a vast graph structure spanning all the subreddits and hyperlinks between them over 2.5 years. 
            Each subreddit is a node, and each hyperlink is a directed edge from one node to another. The first step in our analysis is
            clustering the nodes, or subreddits, using the Leiden Algorithm which ensures a high modularity of approximately 0.42 (meaning nodes inside 
            the same cluster have more links with each other than with nodes in other clusters) and low conductance (meaning 
            there are fewer links going out of each cluster compared to the number of links inside it). The clustering results suggest that
            connectivity across Reddit is highly uneven and does not reach all nodes. Most subreddits belong to one
            large weakly connected cluster of 65 648 nodes, while 711 smaller clusters remain isolated from the main graph.
            However, strong connectivity is much more limited. Only 21 432 nodes form a single strongly connected
            cluster, leaving
            45 563 nodes weakly attached through mostly one-way connections.

        <p><em>The universe is big and not completely connected - A few crowded planets
            constantly receive exchange information, while many others are explored less. Large parts of the galaxy
            are not talked about. Chasing every quiet corner would stretch our energy thin. So we decide to focus on the
            largest social hub, where every planet is interacted with at least once. Links within this large central cluster of communities must be representative
            of the primary linguistic style used in inter-community links.

            We must hurry, the universe is expanding, and we need to make sense of it before it outgrows us!

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0">
            To agregate thousands of subreddits into communities and analytically meaningful structures, we used
            three widely used community detection algorithms - Leiden, Infomap, FastGreedy. To evaluate their

        <p>
            While <strong>FastGreedy</strong> achieves the highest modularity score, its optimization favors dense
            internal grouping at the cost of slightly higher boundary leakage. <strong>Infomap</strong>, in contrast,
            fragments the galaxy into over three thousand micro-clusters, producing a structure that is overly
            fragmented.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <strong>Leiden algorithm</strong> offers the most balanced results. With the lowest
            average conductance (0.198), it identifies 85 clusters while maintaining adequate coverage of
            overall interactions. For this reason we use it in further analyses as main clustering algorithm.

        <h3 style="color: var(--accent-purple);">A Two-Stage Classification of Social Distance</h3>

        <p><em>
            How can we describe different types of links based on social distance?
        </em>

        <p>
            As we aim to characterize how tone and sentiment of communication changes with social distance between communities,
            we subdivide the detected clusters in two stages. First, we define social distance
            within clusters (intra-cluster links), and then across clusters (inter-cluster links).
        </p>

        <ul style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
            <li>
                <strong>Stage 1: Intra-cluster role differentiation</strong><br>
                Within each cluster, nodes are ranked by their within-cluster weighted degree (strength).
                Nodes in the top 30% are labeled as <strong>Core</strong> communities (driving maximum information exchange), 
                while the remaining 70% are labeled as
                <strong>Periphery</strong> nodes.
                A link is classified as an Intra-Core or Intra-Periphery link if it originates from a Core node or a Periphery node respectively,
                and is directed to any other node within the same cluster. 
                This distinction captures whether a mention/edge originates from a structurally central, highly
                connected position within the cluster or from a more weakly connected, peripheral one.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Stage 2: Cross-cluster link strength</strong><br>
                For interactions across clusters, cross-cluster interaction intensity is quantified directly by edge
                weights.
                We compute the median weight of all cross-cluster links and apply a 50/50 split. Links above the
                median are classified as <strong>Strong</strong> links, and those below as <strong>Weak</strong> links,
                yielding a relative separation between higher and lower intensity cross-cluster connections. For example, a link from
                a node in cluster A to a node in cluster B is classified as Cross-Strong or Cross-Weak if the social distance between 
                clusters A and B is short and long respectively. 
            </li>


            <p><em>
                The distribution of links is not equal across all subreddits. We observe that most links fall in the 'Intra-Core' category,
                indicating that most referential information excahange happens within core communities in clusters.

            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">To ensure analytical clarity, we divide interaction contexts into two

            <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
                <li><strong>Peace:</strong> Interactions classified as <strong>positive</strong> or

                </li>
                <li><strong>Conflict:</strong> Interactions classified as <strong>negative</strong>,

            </ul>

        <h3 class="sub-glow">Sentiment stratification</h3>
        <p>
            Reddit hyperlinks can be of positive/neutral sentiment or negative sentiment.
            Negative references are not evenly distributed across subreddits. For example, Cross-strong links contain a
            disproportionately high number of negative references, while intra-periphery links contain the
            fewest; cross-weak and intra-core links show similar levels of positive/neutral and negative links. 
            Pooling all references would therefore let negative links disproportionately drive the aggregate results. To control for
            this bias, we analyze negative and positive/neutral references separately by creating separate graph structures with links of
            a certain sentiment only, and repeating the process of clustering and link-type classification for each graph.

        <p>

            Each cluster in the Reddit galaxy consists of communities with similar topics, norms, and stylistic habits.
            These inherent preferences influence language. Posts from some clusters might favor long sentences, abstract concepts, and
            extended reasoning; others might prefer short, direct, and pragmatic communication. If a specific interaction type
            is dominated by certain clusters, cluster-specific style could be misattributed to social distance.
            To limit this bias, we use a Linear Mixed-Effects Model (LMM). Interaction type is modeled
            as a fixed effect, using Cross-Strong links as the reference category, or baseline with which we will compare
            the values for all other link types. This reduces the influence of
            cluster-specific
            language patterns and allows the fixed effects to capture relative differences associated with link
            type.

            <p style="max-width: 800px; margin: 1rem auto; font-size: 1rem; opacity: 0.8;">
                Our findings lead us to deduce that the interactions within the Reddit galaxy resemble a stable-state information system. 
                The following findings are found based on the linguistic attributes used in links which have a neutral/positive sentiment.
                Language plays a role in determining the structural influence and social attributes of communities.

            <h2 class="rq-title">Macro Perspective: Steady-State Structures and Conflict-Driven Reorganization in the
                Reddit Galaxy</h2></div>
        <p>
            So far, we have examined Reddit interactions at the micro level, focusing on signal complexity, logical
            style, identity markers, and emotional tone. However, a galaxy is not defined by individual signals alone.
            Its structure emerges from the collective motion of stars and clusters. At the macro level, we therefore
            ask a structural question:
            <strong>
                What defines the social architecture of the Reddit galaxy, and what happens to this architecture when
                conflict emerges?
            </strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            All previous analyses were conducted on the <strong>global network</strong>, where positive and negative
            interactions were jointly aggregated. This perspective implicitly assumes that conflict behaves as a local
            disturbance within an otherwise stable system. To test this assumption, we deliberately reconstruct the
            galaxy under two extreme observational lenses:
            a <strong>peace network</strong> containing only positive interactions, and a
            <strong>conflict network</strong> containing only negative interactions.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our analysis follows a clear, step-by-step pipeline:
        </p>

        <ol style="line-height:1.8; padding-left:1.2rem;">
            <li>Extract interaction texts and sentiment labels from the raw Reddit dataset.</li>
            <li>Split the global interaction graph into a peace network (positive links only) and a conflict network
                (negative links only).
            </li>
            <li>Compute <strong>27 linguistic features</strong> for each interaction, including readability metrics,
                sentence structure, pronoun usage, emotional tone, and LIWC categories.
            </li>
            <li>Fit <strong>linear mixed-effects models (LMMs)</strong> to estimate fixed-effect coefficients, producing
                high-dimensional behavioral vectors for each interaction type.
            </li>
            <li>Compare structures across contexts using <strong>Pearson correlation</strong>,
                <strong>Jaccard similarity</strong>, and <strong>feature drift analysis</strong>.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            This pipeline allows us to observe the Reddit galaxy at scale: identifying its stable gravitational
            skeleton, and tracking how conflict perturbs or reorganizes existing orbits.
        </p>

        <p>The clustering results for the three networks are shown below.</p>

            The audit shows that the <strong>Peace</strong> network acts as the galaxy’s structural anchor, closely
            mirroring the <strong>Global</strong> network with near-total connectivity
            (<strong>99.92% LWCC</strong>). In contrast, the <strong>Conflict</strong> network resembles a dense nebula:
            despite its smaller footprint, its density is almost four times higher, while reciprocity drops sharply
            (<strong>0.0675</strong>) and assortativity becomes more negative
            (<strong>-0.1604</strong>).
            Peace sustains stable, reciprocal dialogue, whereas conflict concentrates asymmetric “firepower” across
            dissimilar clusters.
        </p>


        <h3 class="sub-glow">1. Initial Hypothesis: “Mirror-Constant” Structures</h3>
        <p>In the exploratory Phase 0, we observed that positive interactions dominate: roughly 8.35 positive links per
            negative one. This led to the following hypothesis:</p>

        <div class="insight-card" style="border-left-color: var(--accent-gold);">
            <p class="insight-text" style="font-size: 1.05rem;">
                We assume that positive interactions define the Reddit galaxy’s “gravitational skeleton,” determining
                which communities occupy the core, which serve as cross-cluster bridges, and which orbit at the
                periphery. Conflicts may induce local turbulence, but the overall skeletal structure should remain
                stable.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="sub-glow">2. Technical Verification: Peace as the Galaxy’s Anchor</h3>
        <p>To test this, we compared the global network with the peace-only network:</p>
        <ul style="line-height:1.8; padding-left:1.2rem;">
            <li>Computed LMM fixed-effect coefficients for each link, resulting in 27-dimensional high-dimensional
                behavior vectors.
            </li>
            <li>Calculated Pearson correlations between corresponding links in the peace and global networks.</li>
            <li>Observed near-perfect alignment: peripheral links (Intra-Periphery) reached correlations up to 0.99,
                with core links similarly aligned.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="chart-wrapper">
            <iframe class="chart-content"
                    src="{{ '/assets/plots/RQ4/feature_isomorphism_peace.html' | relative_url }}"></iframe>
            <div class="chart-caption">

            </div>
        </div>

        <p>This confirms that positive interactions do not merely dominate in volume—they define the steady-state social
            architecture. <strong>Peace acts as the galaxy’s gravitational anchor</strong>, holding core and peripheral
            clusters in predictable orbits.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-glow">3. Structural Drift: Conflict-Induced Logic Shifts</h3>
        <p>Examining the conflict-only network reveals that the mirror-constant assumption breaks down. Conflict does
            not just amplify existing patterns—it generates a new social gravity, reshaping the galaxy’s landscape.</p>

        <div class="chart-wrapper">
            <iframe class="chart-content"
                    src="{{ '/assets/plots/RQ4/feature_isomorphism_Negative.html' | relative_url }}"></iframe>

        </div>


        <p>Correlations shrink significantly under conflict, with peripheral regions showing the largest divergence.
            This indicates that edge clusters are the first to experience destabilization. <strong>Conflict warps the
                underlying social skeleton</strong>, producing behaviors unseen under steady conditions.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-glow">4. Role Drift & Structural Reorganization</h3>
        <p>To analyze structural reorganization under conflict, we employed a combination of set theory and statistical
            comparison:</p>
        <ul style="line-height:1.8; padding-left:1.2rem;">
            <li><strong>Jaccard Similarity:</strong> Measures the overlap of core members between peace and conflict
                networks, quantifying role retention or migration.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Feature Drift Analysis:</strong> For nodes “relegated” from core to periphery, we track shifts
                in language features (logic, pronouns, emotional tone, readability) before and after migration, testing
                the hypothesis that high traffic does not guarantee structural influence.
            </li>
        </ul>

                <strong>Conclusion:</strong> The Reddit galaxy is a dynamic equilibrium system. Peace defines the
                steady-state social order, while conflict drives localized reorganization. Influence under calm
                conditions does not guarantee influence under pure antagonism—social gravity is context-dependent, and
                roles can invert quickly.
