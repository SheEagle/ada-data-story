        </div>

        <p>Welcome to the Reddit Galaxy. In this vast digital expanse, every <strong>Subreddit</strong> acts as a unique
            planet. These worlds do not exist in isolation; they are tethered by "gravitational bridges"—hyperlinks that
            allow information and users to travel from one corner of the universe to another. To understand this cosmos,
            we first calibrated our instruments to capture the basic signals of inter-community interaction.</p>

        <p>Our initial scan revealed two distinct frequencies of communication: <strong>Title</strong> and
            <strong>Body</strong> mentions. The Title frequency is significantly more active, generating approximately
            572,000 links across 54,075 unique planets—nearly double the volume and 1.5 times the variety found in Body
            mentions (287,000 links). Interestingly, these two frequencies never overlap; every signal is a unique
            star-bridge, suggesting that most interstellar dialogue begins with a high-impact "broadcast" in the title
            rather than within the deeper "crust" of the post body.</p>

        <p>As we tracked this galaxy over a 2.5-year period (2014–2017), we observed a steady, linear expansion ($R^2 =
            0.87$). This is not a chaotic growth, but a rhythmic pulse. Perhaps most encouragingly, the "spectral
            analysis" of these links shows a galaxy dominated by light: <strong>Positive sentiment</strong> links
            outnumber negative ones by a staggering <strong>8.35 to 1</strong>. Furthermore, positive connections are
            expanding at a much faster rate (slope 2.39) than negative ones (slope 0.24), indicating that as the Reddit
            Galaxy grows, it is becoming increasingly defined by constructive alignment rather than friction.</p>

        <p>Zooming out to view the entire topological map, we identified <strong>67,180 planets</strong> interconnected
            by <strong>339,643 bridges</strong>. On average, each planet maintains roughly 10 gravitational ties to
            others, creating a densely populated social space. However, the connectivity is not uniform. We discovered a
            <strong>"Great Super-cluster"</strong>—a massive, weakly connected structure encompassing over 97% (65,648)
            of all known planets. Outside this main civilization, about 711 tiny "Islands" float in deep space,
            consisting of only a handful of planets that remain disconnected from the galactic hub.</p>

        <p>This directed network reveals a clear hierarchy: while the galaxy is physically massive and largely
            reachable, the flow of influence is often one-way. This directional gravity shapes how information cascades
            through the system, moving from influential "super-giants" to the peripheral settlements of the outer
            rim.</p>

            <h2 class="rq-title">Based on community social attributes, what distinct communication patterns can we
                define?</h2>
        </div>

        <p>When we first approached Reddit as a data “galaxy” of this scale, the most intuitive strategy was
            straightforward: to examine what these individual “planets” (subreddits) were talking about. We began with a
            set of content-based embedding vectors representing each community, which functioned much like a resource
            map—highlighting where discussions of technology, entertainment, or shared topical interests were
            concentrated.</p>

        <p>However, it quickly became clear that a purely content-driven perspective was insufficient. Two communities
            that frequently discuss “Bitcoin” are not necessarily close in any meaningful social sense: one may be a
            long-standing supporter community, while the other exists primarily to criticize or mock it. Treating them
            as neighbors solely on the basis of shared vocabulary obscures the more consequential social structure
            beneath. Content captures what communities talk about, but it offers limited insight into whom they align
            with.</p>

        <p>For this reason, we shifted our focus away from the content map and toward a more fundamental layer of the
            system: the hyperlink structure connecting communities. Each citation, cross-post, or reference represents a
            point of contact between subreddits—whether as endorsement, borrowing, critique, or confrontation. Using
            these links, we constructed an inter-community network and applied the Leiden clustering algorithm to
            identify cohesive “constellations” within it. Compared to traditional classification methods, Leiden is
            particularly effective at detecting groups that are structurally dense and interactionally cohesive, making
            these constellations a closer approximation of Reddit’s operative social topology.</p>

        <p>Once this structural star map was established, a new challenge emerged: how to characterize the “social
            distance” between communities. A binary distinction between interactions occurring within the same
            constellation and those crossing constellation boundaries proved too coarse, as it could not account for why
            some cross-community exchanges remain measured and constructive while others escalate rapidly into
            hostility.</p>

        <p>To address this, we further partitioned all interactions into four categories, which form the analytical

            <span class="rq-label">Research Question 02</span>
            <h2 class="rq-title">How do the social attributes of communication links—defined by intra-community roles
                and cross-community connection strength—determine baseline linguistic patterns in a peaceful
                context?</h2>
        </div>

        <p>In the previous stage, we conceptualized Reddit as a galaxy of tens of thousands of communities and
            identified four fundamental interaction types: <strong>Intra-Core, Intra-Periphery, Cross-Strong, and
                Cross-Weak</strong>.</p>

        <p>With Research Question 02, we move beyond describing the structure itself and ask a more focused question:
            <strong>Once major confounding factors are removed, how does social distance shape language use?</strong>
        </p>

        <p>This question seems straightforward but is methodologically delicate. Raw data cannot directly answer it, as
            they are heavily influenced by covariates. Without proper control, any patterns observed might reflect noise
            rather than genuine effects. The goal here is not simply to “discover patterns” but to systematically
            calibrate the data and determine which linguistic differences are truly driven by social distance.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-glow">First Calibration: Controlling Conflict Rate</h3>
        <p>The first source of distortion is the uneven distribution of conflict across interaction types.</p>
        <p>Conflict is not evenly spread in the Reddit galaxy. Cross-Strong interactions show a much higher frequency of
            antagonistic language than internal community interactions. By contrast, Intra-Core and Intra-Periphery
            interactions are generally more restrained. Analyzing all messages together would allow high-conflict
            language to mask the structural properties of everyday communication.</p>
        <div class="container-wide">
            <div class="chart-wrapper">
                <iframe class="chart-content"

                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>To address this, we divide the corpus into peaceful and conflictual contexts. This is not to diminish the
            importance of conflict but to ensure that structural language patterns reflect social distance rather than
            emotional escalation. In this analysis, we focus first on the peaceful context, where language choices
            reliably reflect communicative expectations and audience perception.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-glow">Second Calibration: Controlling Source Clusters</h3>
        <p>Even within peaceful interactions, a second confound exists: the Source Cluster.</p>
        <p>Each cluster in the Reddit galaxy consists of communities with similar topics, norms, and stylistic habits.
            These inherent preferences influence language. Some clusters favor long sentences, abstract concepts, and
            extended reasoning; others prefer short, direct, and pragmatic communication. If a specific interaction type
            is dominated by certain clusters, cluster-specific style could be misattributed to social distance.</p>
        <p>To remove this bias, we apply a <strong>Linear Mixed-Effects Model (LMM)</strong>. Each message’s source
            cluster is treated as a random effect, absorbing cluster-level stylistic differences. The remaining fixed
            effects therefore more reliably reflect the influence of interaction type itself. Effectively, the LMM
            allows us to observe language in the Reddit galaxy after subtracting local cultural coloration.</p>

                After both calibrations, we can treat the Reddit galaxy as operating in a stable state. Language now
                reflects social distance’s structural influence rather than conflict or cluster culture.

            <h2 class="rq-title">Macro Perspective: Steady-State Structures and Conflict-Driven Reorganization in the
                Reddit Galaxy</h2>
        </div>

        <p>Up until now, we’ve explored how different communication links behave at the micro-level, analyzing signal
            complexity, logic, identity markers, and emotional tone. But a galaxy isn’t defined by individual signals
            alone—it is the interplay of all its stars and clusters. At a macro scale, we face a structural question:
            <strong>What fundamentally defines the social architecture of the Reddit galaxy? When conflicts erupt, does
                this architecture remain resilient, or does it collapse and reorganize?</strong></p>

        <p>To address this, we adopt a multi-dimensional LMM coefficient vector framework, which allows us to track the
            stability and divergence of interaction patterns across different social contexts. This framework provides a
            way to map the galaxy’s structural “gravity wells” and observe how they shift under conflict.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-glow">1. Initial Hypothesis: “Mirror-Constant” Structures</h3>
        <p>In the exploratory Phase 0, we observed that the Reddit galaxy is dominated by positive interactions: roughly
            8.35 positive links for every negative one. This led to an intuitive hypothesis:</p>

        <div class="insight-card" style="border-left-color: var(--accent-gold);">
            <p class="insight-text" style="font-size: 1.1rem; font-style: normal;">
                Positive interactions define the social skeleton of the galaxy. They determine who occupies the core,
                who bridges clusters, and who orbits the periphery. Conflicts may add turbulence, but they should not
                fundamentally reshape this skeleton—at most, they change the “color” of the network without altering its
                structure.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>In other words, the galaxy’s structural backbone, formed by the majority of positive links, was expected to
            remain <strong>mirror-constant</strong>, stable across both friendly and adversarial interactions.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-glow">2. Technical Verification: Peace as the Galaxy’s “Anchor”</h3>
        <p>To test this, we compared two perspectives: <strong>Global Perspective</strong> (including all interactions)
            and <strong>Purely Positive Perspective</strong> (filtering out conflicts).</p>

        <div class="info-card" style="background: rgba(0, 243, 255, 0.03); margin-bottom: 2rem;">
            <span class="card-title" style="color: var(--accent-cyan);">Methodology & Observations</span>
            <p class="card-desc">
                We extracted the fixed-effect coefficients for 27 language features, producing high-dimensional behavior
                vectors for each link. Computing Pearson correlation coefficients revealed <strong>near-perfect
                alignment</strong>: peripheral links (Intra-Periphery) demonstrate correlations as high as
                <strong>0.99</strong>.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>This implies that positive interactions are not just dominant in volume—they define the steady-state social
            architecture of the Reddit galaxy. <strong>Peace acts as the galaxy’s gravitational anchor</strong>, holding
            core and peripheral clusters in predictable orbits.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container-text">
        <h3 class="sub-glow">3. Structural Divergence: Conflict-Induced Logic Shifts</h3>
        <p>When we shift to a purely negative perspective, the mirror-constant assumption breaks. Conflict does not
            simply amplify existing patterns—it creates a new social gravity, one that reshapes the galaxy’s
            landscape.</p>

    <div class="container-text">
        <p>Observations show that correlations shrink significantly under conflict. Peripheral regions (Intra-Periphery)
            show the largest divergence, indicating that clusters at the edge of the galaxy are the first to experience
            structural destabilization. <strong>Conflict warps the underlying social skeleton</strong>, producing
            behaviors unseen under steady conditions.</p>

                <strong>Conclusion:</strong> The Reddit galaxy is a dynamic equilibrium system, where peace defines the
                steady-state social order, and conflict drives localized reorganization. Influence in calm conditions
                does not guarantee influence under pure antagonism—social gravity is context-sensitive, and roles can
                invert quickly.
