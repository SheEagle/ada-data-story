        </div>

        <p>Welcome to the Galaxy of Reddit. In this vast digital expanse, every planet is called a
            <strong>Subreddit</strong>
            pooling together likeminded thinkers from across the galaxy. These planets do not exist in isolation.
            They are socially connected through their inhabitants, called <strong>users</strong> constantly debating and communicating.
            These users are complete information haulers, during theyr visits to other planets they send reports to
            theyr current home planet <strong>mentioning</strong> things that caught theyr attention. And these reports
            can be
            quite emotional having positive/neutral or negative outlook on things. In other words having different
            <strong>sentiment</strong>.
            This inborn behaviour alows information flow across the galaxy and socialy <strong>links</strong> planets
            closer togehter.
            We, the geeky inhabitants of planet EPFL, are fascinated by these referential migration patterns and want to
            understand how information spreads through this galaxy. To observe
            them, we calibrated our instruments to spy on these traveling user reports. (This involves no privacy
            breach. In this universe, all reports are anonymous unless users deliberately reveal their identities).

        <p> Our initial scan revealed two distinct styles of user reports. Some users are careful, embedding the planets
            names deep within the <strong>body</strong> of their report. Others are careless, broadcasting the planet
            they are talking about in the <strong>title</strong> for all to see. Since tracking all the reports is over
            our limits, we called
            for help from a scholarly planet known as Stanford, which provided historical Galaxy report records from
            2014 to 2017 from what they call the <strong>Reddit Hyperlink Network</strong> program.
            Using analytical tools granted by the galaxy’s overseers, ADA, we explored these traveling reports and
            uncovered unexpected and sometimes unsettling information pathways.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>This is the story of how we became the Variance Vanguards of the subreddit galaxy.</strong>

        <p><em>To keep both explorers and scientists satisfied, we switch to precise terminology
            for the analysis that follows, returning to the narrative when interpreting what we observe in cursive.</em>


        <h2 class="rq-title">An Expanding Reddit Universe</h2>


        <p> Over a 2.5-year period Reddit Hyperlink Network dataset tracks we managed to observe approximately
            860 000 mentions, with title citations taking two thirds of total links totaling 572 000 across 54 075
            unique subredits.
            In this 2.5-year period weekly posts mentioning other subredits grew in a steady pace with growth
            following a strong linear trend (<em>R</em><sup>2</sup> = 0.87) (Figure <a href="#linear_exp">0.1</a>),
            most of the observed growth being positive or neutral sentiment mentions. With positive/neutral sentiment
            outnumbering
            the negative by 8.35 to 1. Furthermore, linear regression reveals a substantially steeper growth rate for
            positive and
            neutral mentions (slope = 2.39) than for negative mentions (slope = 0.24) (Figure <a
                    href="#sentiment_slope">0.2</a>).
        </p>

        <p><em>That’s a nice universe expansion metric! The Reddit universe is growing faster than its negativity.</em>

        <p> Connectivity across Reddit is highly uneven and does not reach all nodes. Most subreddits belong to one
            large
            weakly connected cluster of 65 648 nodes, while 711 smaller clusters remain isolated from the main graph.
            However, strong connectivity is much more limited. Only 21 432 nodes form a single strongly connected
            cluster, leaving
            45 563 nodes weakly attached through mostly one-way connections.

        <p><em>After a short warm-up with the data, reality sets in. This universe is big and not complitely wired. A
            few crowded planets
            constantly receive reports about each other, while many others gets explored less. Large parts of the galaxy
            are not talked about.
            <br>
            <br>
            - Maybe they are boring?
            <br>
            <br>
            Chasing every quiet corner would stretch our efforts thin. So we do the sensible thing, we focus on the
            largest social hub, where
            reports reach all the planets at least once. If there is a coherent
            story about how Reddit talks about itself, this is where it should speak the loudest.
            <br>
            <br>
            - Wait, the administartion of ADA requested a reaserch questions before granting theyr tools and knowladge?
            <br>
            - How can we know what to write if we don't know what tools they will let us use?
            <br>
            - Quicly, just make something up, we will ajust as we go.
            <br>
            <br>
            We must hurry, the universe is expanding, and we need to make sense of it before it outgrows us.

        <p>
            While <strong>FastGreedy</strong> achieves the highest modularity score, its optimization favors dense
            internal grouping at the cost of slightly higher boundary leakage. <strong>Infomap</strong>, in contrast,
            fragments the galaxy into over three thousand micro-clusters, producing a structure that is overly fragmented.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <strong>Leiden algorithm</strong> offers the most balanced results. With the lowest
            average conductance (0.198), it identifies 85 clusters while maintaining adequate coverage of 
            overall interactions. For this reason we use it in further analyses as main clustering algorithm.

        <p><em>
        How can we decribe social distance?
        </em>

        <p>
            As we aim to characterize how tone and emotions change with social distance, 
            we subdivide the detected clusters in two stages. First, we define social distance 
            within clusters, and then across clusters.
        </p>

        <ul style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
            <li>
                <strong>Stage 1: Intra-cluster role differentiation</strong><br>
                Within each cluster, nodes are ranked by their within-cluster weighted degree (strength). 
                Nodes in the top 30% are labeled as <strong>Core</strong>, while the remaining 70% are labeled as
                <strong>Periphery</strong>.
                This distinction captures whether a mention/edge originates from a structurally central, highly connected 
                position within the cluster or from a more weakly connected, peripheral one.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Stage 2: Cross-cluster link strength</strong><br>
                For interactions across clusters, cross-cluster interaction intensity is quantified directly by edge weights.
                We compute the median weight of all cross-cluster links and apply an 50/50 split. Links above the 
                median are classified as <strong>Strong</strong>, and those below as <strong>Weak</strong>, 
                yielding a relative separation between higher and lower intensity cross-cluster connections.
            </li>


            <p><em>
            Distribution of reports does not fall in equal proportions, that core planetary cluster is really socialy tightly conected.                Top 30% of most conected together planets really really send alot of reports about each other.

            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">To ensure analytical clarity, we divide interaction contexts into two
                categories based on the sentiment of links:</p>
            <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
                <li><strong>Peace:</strong> Interactions classified as <strong>positive</strong> or
                    <strong>neutral</strong>,
                    representing the galaxy’s steady state.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Conflict:</strong> Interactions classified as <strong>negative</strong>,
                    representing periods of instability or disturbance.

            </ul>

        <h3 class="sub-glow">Sentiment stratification</h3>
        <p>
            Negative references are not evenly distributed across subreddits. Cross-strong links contain a 
            disproportionately high share of negative references, while intra-periphery links contain the 
            fewest; cross-weak and intra-core links show similar levels. Pooling all references would 
            therefore let negative links disproportionately drive the aggregate results. To control for 
            this bias, we analyze negative and positive or neutral references separately.

            These inherent preferences influence language. Some clusters favor long sentences, abstract concepts, and
            extended reasoning; others prefer short, direct, and pragmatic communication. If a specific interaction type
            is dominated by certain clusters, cluster-specific style could be misattributed to social distance.
            To limit this bias, we use a Linear Mixed-Effects Model (LMM). Interaction type is modeled 
            as a fixed effect, using cross-strong links as the reference category. This reduces the influence of cluster-specific 
            language patterns and allows the fixed effects to capture relative differences associated with interaction type.

                After both calibrations, we can treat the Reddit galaxy as operating in a stable state. Language now
                reflects social attributes’ structural influence rather than conflict or cluster culture.

            <h2 class="rq-title">Macro Perspective: Steady-State Structures and Conflict-Driven Reorganization in the
                Reddit Galaxy</h2></div>
        <p>So far, we have analyzed communication links at the micro level, examining signal complexity, logic, identity
            markers, and emotional tone. However, a galaxy is not defined by individual signals alone—it is shaped by
            the interplay of stars and clusters. At the macro level, we face a structural question: <strong>What
                fundamentally defines the social architecture of the Reddit galaxy? When conflicts emerge, does this
                architecture remain stable, or does it reorganize?</strong></p>

        <p>Previous analyses were conducted on the <strong>global network</strong>, considering both positive and
            negative interactions together. To test the robustness of the observed structures, we reconstructed the
            galaxy under two extreme observational lenses: one network containing only <strong>positive links</strong>
            (peace network) and another containing only <strong>negative links</strong> (conflict network).</p>

        <p>First, we conducted a short network analysis of these 3 networks.</p>

        <p>The network audit reveals that the **Peace** sub-network serves as the galaxy’s structural anchor, mirroring
            the **Global** skeleton with near-total connectivity (**99.92% LWCC**). In contrast, the **Conflict**
            network behaves like a dense nebula; despite its smaller footprint, its density is nearly four times higher,
            yet it suffers from a sharp drop in reciprocity (**0.0675**) and deeper negative assortativity
            (**-0.1604**). This confirms that while peace facilitates a stable, mutual dialogue that defines the social
            order, conflict manifests as concentrated, one-sided "firepower coverage" that triggers structural drift
            across dissimilar clusters.</p>

                    Figure 4.1 - Structural Fingerprints: While Peace mirrors the Global skeleton, Conflict exhibits a

            <li>Extract text and sentiment labels for each interaction from the raw Reddit data.</li>
            <li>Construct two separate networks: a peace network (only positive interactions) and a conflict network
                (only negative interactions).
            </li>
            <li>Compute 27 language features for each link, including readability, sentence length, pronoun usage,
                emotional tone, and LIWC categories.
            </li>
            <li>Fit a linear mixed-effects model (LMM) to extract fixed-effect coefficients, producing high-dimensional
                behavior vectors for each link.
            </li>
            <li>Compare peace and conflict contexts using Pearson correlations, Jaccard similarity, and feature drift
                analysis to track structural stability and role shifts.
            </li>

            negative one. This led to the following hypothesis:</p>

        <div class="insight-card" style="border-left-color: var(--accent-gold);">
            <p class="insight-text" style="font-size: 1.05rem;">
                We assume that positive interactions define the Reddit galaxy’s “gravitational skeleton,” determining
                which communities occupy the core, which serve as cross-cluster bridges, and which orbit at the
                periphery. Conflicts may induce local turbulence, but the overall skeletal structure should remain
                stable.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3 class="sub-glow">2. Technical Verification: Peace as the Galaxy’s Anchor</h3>
        <p>To test this, we compared the global network with the peace-only network:</p>
        <ul style="line-height:1.8; padding-left:1.2rem;">
            <li>Computed LMM fixed-effect coefficients for each link, resulting in 27-dimensional high-dimensional
                behavior vectors.
            </li>
            <li>Calculated Pearson correlations between corresponding links in the peace and global networks.</li>
            <li>Observed near-perfect alignment: peripheral links (Intra-Periphery) reached correlations up to 0.99,
                with core links similarly aligned.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="chart-wrapper">
            <iframe class="chart-content"
                    src="{{ '/assets/plots/RQ4/feature_isomorphism_peace.html' | relative_url }}"></iframe>
            <div class="chart-caption">
                Figure 4.4
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>This confirms that positive interactions do not merely dominate in volume—they define the steady-state social
            architecture. <strong>Peace acts as the galaxy’s gravitational anchor</strong>, holding core and peripheral
            clusters in predictable orbits.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-glow">3. Structural Drift: Conflict-Induced Logic Shifts</h3>
        <p>Examining the conflict-only network reveals that the mirror-constant assumption breaks down. Conflict does
            not just amplify existing patterns—it generates a new social gravity, reshaping the galaxy’s landscape.</p>

        <div class="chart-wrapper">
            <iframe class="chart-content"
                    src="{{ '/assets/plots/RQ4/feature_isomorphism_Negative.html' | relative_url }}"></iframe>

                Figure 4.5
            </div>
        </div>


        <p>Correlations shrink significantly under conflict, with peripheral regions showing the largest divergence.
            This indicates that edge clusters are the first to experience destabilization. <strong>Conflict warps the
                underlying social skeleton</strong>, producing behaviors unseen under steady conditions.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-glow">4. Role Drift & Structural Reorganization</h3>
        <p>To analyze structural reorganization under conflict, we employed a combination of set theory and statistical
            comparison:</p>
        <ul style="line-height:1.8; padding-left:1.2rem;">
            <li><strong>Jaccard Similarity:</strong> Measures the overlap of core members between peace and conflict
                networks, quantifying role retention or migration.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Feature Drift Analysis:</strong> For nodes “relegated” from core to periphery, we track shifts
                in language features (logic, pronouns, emotional tone, readability) before and after migration, testing
                the hypothesis that high traffic does not guarantee structural influence.
            </li>
        </ul>

                <strong>Conclusion:</strong> The Reddit galaxy is a dynamic equilibrium system. Peace defines the
                steady-state social order, while conflict drives localized reorganization. Influence under calm
                conditions does not guarantee influence under pure antagonism—social gravity is context-dependent, and
                roles can invert quickly.
