        </div>

        <p>Welcome to the Galaxy of Reddit : a massive social networking platform, known for its vast communities
            (subreddits) on discussions,
            news, expert advice, entertainment (memes, stories), and various niche topics. In Reddit's vast digital
            expanse, every planet (
            <strong>Subreddit</strong>)
            pools together likeminded thinkers from across the galaxy. These planets do not exist in isolation.
            They are socially connected through their inhabitants, called <strong>users</strong> constantly debating and
            communicating.
            Discussions on Reddit forums can take various forms and encompass all kinds of emotion (positive, negative,
            angry, appreciative, etc.).
            When one subreddit references another subreddit (by adding a link to a post/conversation in the target
            subreddit), there is information
            flow between communities as they interact. Some subreddits interact more frequently than others - making the
            planets
            knit together closely through social interaction.
            We, the geeky inhabitants of planet r/EPFL, are fascinated by these information exchange patterns and want
            to
            understand how the linguistic style of communication varies for different links within Reddit's online
            galaxy. To observe
            them, we calibrated our instruments to spy on these intra-planet links!

        <p> Our initial scan revealed two distinct styles of intra-community links. Some users embed the links to other
            communities' posts
            deep within the <strong>body</strong> of the post, while others mention it in the <strong>title</strong>
            itself.
            Stanford's <strong>Reddit Hyperlink Network</strong> record all such hyperlinks from
            2014 to 2017. Using analytical tools granted by the galaxy’s data analysis overseers, ADA, we explored these
            hyperlinks and
            uncovered interesting (and sometimes unexpected) information pathways.

                Reddit Hyperlink Network dataset

            contains approximately
            <strong>860,000 hyperlinks</strong>
            from one community to another, over a period of
            <strong>2.5 years</strong>,
            with title citations forming
            <strong>two thirds of the total 572,000 links</strong>
            across
            <strong>54,075 unique subreddits</strong>
            in the dataset.

            In this 2.5-year period, the
            weekly number of posts mentioning other subreddits grew at a steady pace,
            following a
            strong linear trend
            (<em>R</em><sup>2</sup> = <strong>0.87</strong>)
            (Figure
            <a href="#linear_exp" class="my-link">0.1</a>),
            with most posts encompassing
            positive or neutral sentiment.
            (The ratio of positive/neutral sentiment to negative was
            <strong>8.35 : 1</strong>!)

            Furthermore, linear regression reveals a
            substantially steeper growth rate
            for positive and neutral mentions
            (<strong>slope = 2.39</strong>)
            than for negative mentions
            (<strong>slope = 0.24</strong>)

            We model the Reddit Hyperlink Network as a vast graph structure spanning all the subreddits and hyperlinks
            between them over <strong>2.5 years</strong>.
            Each subreddit is a node, and each hyperlink is a directed edge from one node to another. Our initial
            clustering analysis
            (details provided later) suggests that connectivity across Reddit is highly uneven and does not reach
            all nodes. Most subreddits belong to one large weakly connected cluster of <strong>65,648 nodes</strong>,
            while <strong>711 smaller
            clusters</strong> remain
            isolated from the main graph.
            However, strong connectivity is much more limited. Only <strong>21,432 nodes</strong> form a single strongly
            connected
            cluster, leaving
            <strong>45,563 nodes</strong> weakly attached through mostly one-way connections.

            Our structural scan reveals that this expanding universe is not perfectly connected. While a few crowded
            planets constantly exchange <strong>messages</strong>, vast regions remain silent or isolated. To ensure our
            instruments capture the most representative data, we <strong>focus on the largest social hub</strong>—a
            massive cluster where every community is interacted with at least once.

                Periphery satellite) and its <strong>Social Distance</strong> from others dictate the way <strong>communication</strong>
                is crafted. By contrasting these patterns across <strong>Peace</strong> and <strong>Conflict
                Contexts</strong>, we reveal whether the structural "where" fundamentally determines the linguistic

            Community aggregation
        </h3>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 0">
            Since social networks are known to exhibit community structures, hence to better understand the dynamics
            of communication between subreddits, we first need to identify and aggregate them into larger communities
            based on their interaction patterns.
            For this, we used
            three widely used community detection algorithms : Leiden, Infomap, FastGreedy. To evaluate their
            performance we used:

            <li>
                🔸 <strong>Modularity:</strong> Measures how tightly interactions are concentrated within clusters,
                reflecting the strength of internal gravitational binding.
            </li>
            <li>
                🔸 <strong>Conductance:</strong> Captures how much interaction “leaks” across cluster boundaries; lower
                values indicate sharpercommunity structure, more stable borders between star systems.
            </li>
            <li>
                🔸 <strong>Coverage:</strong> Indicates the proportion of total interactions in the galaxy that are
                internal to the clusters.

        <p>
            While <strong>FastGreedy</strong> achieves the highest modularity score, its optimization favors dense
            internal grouping at the cost of slightly higher boundary leakage. <strong>Infomap</strong>, in contrast,
            fragments the galaxy into over three thousand micro clusters, producing a structure that is overly
            fragmented.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <strong>Leiden algorithm</strong> offers the most balanced results. With the lowest
            average conductance (0.198), it identifies 85 clusters while maintaining adequate coverage of
            overall interactions. For this reason we use it in further analyses as main clustering algorithm.

                Within each community cluster, communities are ranked by <strong>weighted degree (total connection

                strength)</strong> to identify their influence levels:

                <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">

                    </li>

                </ul>

                Based on this, we define the first two groups:

                    <li><strong>Intra-Core:</strong> Links initiated by core communities targeting other members within

                frequency (edge weight). Using the median as a threshold, we define the remaining two groups:

                linguistic patterns and emotional tone of interactions in a peaceful context?</h2>
        </div>

        <div style="background: rgba(0, 195, 255, 0.1); border-left: 4px solid var(--accent-cyan); padding: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0; border-radius: 4px;">
            <h4 style="color: var(--accent-cyan); margin-top: 0;">📋 Core Terminology</h4>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">To ensure analytical clarity, we operationalize our definitions based on
                the Reddit Hyperlink Network attributes:</p>
            <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
                <li><strong>Interaction, Communication & Message:</strong> These terms refer specifically to the act of
                    one community <strong>referencing</strong> another via a directed hyperlink.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Peace Context:</strong> References with <strong>positive</strong> or
                    <strong>neutral</strong> sentiment (<code>POST_LABEL = 1</code>), representing the network's
                    baseline steady state.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Conflict Context:</strong> References with <strong>negative</strong> sentiment (<code>POST_LABEL
                    = -1</code>), representing inter-community friction and social pressure.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>In the previous stage, we defined four types of links: <strong>Intra-Core, Intra-Periphery, Cross-Strong, and
            Cross-Weak</strong>. But before we move further with our analysis, we need to take into account sentiment
            type and cross-cluster differences.</p>
        <p>
        </p>

        <h3 class="sub-glow">Controlling conflict rate</h3>
        <p>
            Reddit hyperlinks can be of positive/neutral sentiment or negative sentiment.
            Negative references are not evenly distributed across subreddits. For example, Cross-strong links contain a
            disproportionately high number of negative references, while intra-periphery links contain the
            fewest; cross-weak and intra-core links show similar levels of positive/neutral and negative links.
            Pooling all references would therefore let negative links disproportionately drive the aggregate results. To
            control for
            this bias, we analyze negative and positive/neutral references separately by creating separate graph
            structures with links of
            a certain sentiment only, and repeating the process of clustering and link-type classification for each
            graph.

        <h3 class="sub-glow">Controlling cluster specific differences</h3>
        <p>

            Each cluster in the Reddit galaxy consists of communities with similar topics, norms, and stylistic habits.
            These inherent preferences influence language. Posts from some clusters might favor long sentences, abstract
            concepts, and
            extended reasoning; others might prefer short, direct, and pragmatic communication. If a specific
            interaction type
            is dominated by certain clusters, cluster-specific style could be misattributed to social distance.
            To limit this bias, we use a Linear Mixed-Effects Model (LMM). Interaction type is modeled
            as a fixed effect, using Cross-Strong links as the reference category, or baseline with which we will
            compare
            the values for all other link types. This reduces the influence of
            cluster-specific
            language patterns and allows the fixed effects to capture relative differences associated with link
            type.

            After breaking down Reddit interactions along several communication dimensions, such as linguistic
            complexity,
            identity signals, and emotional tone, we can step back and look at the bigger picture.
            Together, these patterns suggest that communication in the Reddit whithween social groups does not happen
            randomly.
            Instead, it tends to cluster into a small number of recurring styles shaped by <strong>who speaks</strong>
            (social roles) and <strong>how far is the subject about which a refrence is made</strong> (social distance).

            Each profile can be seen as a different kind of star system in the galaxy:
            some are dense and stable, some sit on the edges, and others act as bridges between distant clusters.
            These profiles do not describe individuals, but rather the typical communication patterns that emerge
            under different social positions and distances.

            <h2 class="rq-title">How does the global network architecture differ when constructed using only positive
                versus
                only negative links, and does conflict based network drive a reshuffling of community
                centrality and influence?</h2></div>
        <p>
            So far, we have examined Reddit interactions at the micro level, focusing on language complexity, logical
            style, identity expression, and emotional tone. However, a galaxy is not defined by individual signals
            alone.
            Its structure emerges from the collective motion of stars and clusters. At the macro level, we therefore
            ask a structural question:
            <strong>
                What defines the social architecture of the Reddit galaxy, and what happens to this architecture when
                we only use conflict links?
            </strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            All previous analyses were conducted on the <strong>global network</strong>, where positive and negative
            interactions were jointly aggregated. This perspective implicitly assumes that conflict behaves as a local
            disturbance within an otherwise stable system. To test this assumption, we deliberately reconstruct the
            galaxy under two different observational lenses:
            a <strong>peace network</strong> containing only positive interactions, and a
            <strong>conflict network</strong> containing only negative interactions.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our analysis follows a clear, step-by-step pipeline:
        </p>

        <ol style="line-height:1.8; padding-left:1.2rem;">
            <li>Extract interaction texts and sentiment labels from the raw Reddit dataset.</li>
            <li>Split the global interaction graph into a peace network (positive links only) and a conflict network
                (negative links only).
            </li>
            <li>Compute <strong>27 linguistic features</strong> for each interaction, including readability metrics,
                sentence structure, pronoun usage, emotional tone, and LIWC categories.
            </li>
            <li>Fit <strong>linear mixed-effects models (LMMs)</strong> to estimate fixed effect coefficients, producing
                high dimensional behavioral vectors for each interaction type.
            </li>
            <li>Compare structures across contexts using <strong>Pearson correlation</strong>,
                <strong>Jaccard similarity</strong>, and <strong>feature drift analysis</strong>.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            This pipeline allows us to observe the Reddit galaxy at scale: identifying its stable gravitational
            skeleton, and tracking how conflict perturbs or reorganizes existing orbits.
        </p>

            The audit shows that the <strong>Positive</strong> network acts as the galaxy’s structural anchor, closely
            mirroring the <strong>Global</strong> network with high <strong>Density</strong>,
            <strong>Reciprocity</strong>
            and <strong>Average Degree</strong>. In contrast, the <strong>Negative</strong> network is macroscopically
            fragmented with few connections per cluster (low <strong>Density</strong> and <strong>Average
            Degree</strong>)
            and structurally separated (lowest <strong>Assortativity</strong>), indicating that conflict does not
            involve
            the whole community and may follow rigid hierarchical lines. However, the highest <strong>Average
            Clustering</strong>
            in the Negative network reveals that while conflict is not widespread, it is concentrated in small, tight
            circles of communities who interact heavily with each other.
            In short, peace sustains stable, reciprocal dialogue, whereas conflict concentrates asymmetric “firepower”
            across
            dissimilar clusters.

        <p>This confirms that positive interactions do not merely dominate in volume; they define the overall social
            architecture. <strong>Peace network acts as the galaxy’s gravitational anchor</strong>, holding core and
            peripheral
            clusters in predictable orbits.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-glow">2. Structural Drift: Conflict-Induced Logic Shifts</h3>
        <p>Examining the conflict-only network reveals that the entire galaxy's structure breaks down. Conflict does
            not just amplify existing patterns it generates a new social gravity, reshaping the galaxy’s landscape.</p>

        <p>Correlations shrink significantly under conflict, with peripheral regions showing the largest divergence.
            This indicates that edge clusters are the first to experience destabilization. <strong>Conflict warps the
                underlying social skeleton</strong>, producing behaviors unseen under normal conditions.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-glow">3. Structural Reorganization based on Conflicts</h3>
        <p>To identify differences in network structure when only conflict is considered, we imagine that our original
            Peace network is changed into a conflict-only network. To analyze structural reorganization during this
            transition, we employed a combination of set theory and statistical
            comparison:</p>
        <ul style="line-height:1.8; padding-left:1.2rem;">
            <li><strong>Jaccard Similarity:</strong> Measures the overlap of core members between peace and conflict
                networks, quantifying role retention or migration.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Feature Drift Analysis:</strong> For nodes “demoted” from core to periphery, we track shifts
                in language features (logic, pronouns, emotional tone, readability) before and after the transition,
                testing
                the hypothesis that high traffic does not guarantee a Peaceful structural influence.

                <strong>Conclusion:</strong> The Reddit galaxy is a dynamic equilibrium system. Positive interactions
                establish a stable social structure, anchoring communities into predictable roles. Conflict, in
                contrast,
                drives structural drift, destabilizing established cores and enabling the rise of previously peripheral
                nodes.
                Influence on Reddit is therefore context dependent: prominence in peaceful discourse does not
                necessarily
                translate to dominance in conflict, and network hierarchies can rapidly reshuffle under antagonistic
                conditions.

        <p>
            Our voyage through the Reddit Galaxy reveals a profound truth: <strong>the structural "where" dictates the
            linguistic "how."</strong> Online communication is not a chaotic void, but a sophisticated ecosystem
            governed by social gravity and structural roles.

                <p style="font-size: 0.95rem;">
                    Communication patterns are not random. Whether a community is a <strong>Core</strong> hub or a
                    <strong>Periphery</strong> satellite determines its baseline "voice": from the complex reasoning of
                    the center to the attention-seeking signals of the edges.

                <p style="font-size: 0.95rem;">
                    Conflict acts as a revealer, sharpening the distinctions between social roles. In a <strong>Conflict
                    Context</strong>, the gap between groups widens: the Periphery erupts in raw, unstructured
                    emotional flares, while the Core uses logic and group identity to defend their position.

                    Influence is context-dependent. A star that shines brightly in the <strong>Peace Network</strong>
                    may lose its gravity in the <strong>Conflict Network</strong>. Antagonism doesn't just change
                    behavior; it triggers a <strong>systemic reshuffling</strong> of the social hierarchy.

                As the Reddit Universe continues to expand, the tribes within it will keep orbiting their shared
                interests. Some will act as bridges (<strong>Cross-Strong</strong>), maintaining logic amidst the noise;
                others will remain as isolated signals (<strong>Cross-Weak</strong>). By understanding these linguistic
                echoes, we gain more than just data—we see the invisible social architecture that connects us all in the
                digital expanse.
