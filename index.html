        </div>

        <p>Welcome to the Reddit Galaxy. In this vast digital expanse, every <strong>Subreddit</strong> acts as a unique
            planet. These worlds do not exist in isolation; they are tethered by "gravitational bridges"—hyperlinks that
            allow information and users to travel from one corner of the universe to another. To understand this cosmos,
            we first calibrated our instruments to capture the basic signals of inter-community interaction.</p>

        <p>Our initial scan revealed two distinct frequencies of communication: <strong>Title</strong> and
            <strong>Body</strong> mentions. The Title frequency is significantly more active, generating approximately
            572,000 links across 54,075 unique planets—nearly double the volume and 1.5 times the variety found in Body
            mentions (287,000 links). Interestingly, these two frequencies never overlap; every signal is a unique
            star-bridge, suggesting that most interstellar dialogue begins with a high-impact "broadcast" in the title
            rather than within the deeper "crust" of the post body.</p>

        <p>As we tracked this galaxy over a 2.5-year period (2014–2017), we observed a steady, linear expansion ($R^2 =
            0.87$). This is not a chaotic growth, but a rhythmic pulse. Perhaps most encouragingly, the "spectral
            analysis" of these links shows a galaxy dominated by light: <strong>Positive sentiment</strong> links
            outnumber negative ones by a staggering <strong>8.35 to 1</strong>. Furthermore, positive connections are
            expanding at a much faster rate (slope 2.39) than negative ones (slope 0.24), indicating that as the Reddit
            Galaxy grows, it is becoming increasingly defined by constructive alignment rather than friction.</p>

        <p>Zooming out to view the entire topological map, we identified <strong>67,180 planets</strong> interconnected
            by <strong>339,643 bridges</strong>. On average, each planet maintains roughly 10 gravitational ties to
            others, creating a densely populated social space. However, the connectivity is not uniform. We discovered a
            <strong>"Great Super-cluster"</strong>—a massive, weakly connected structure encompassing over 97% (65,648)
            of all known planets. Outside this main civilization, about 711 tiny "Islands" float in deep space,
            consisting of only a handful of planets that remain disconnected from the galactic hub.</p>

        <p>This directed network reveals a clear hierarchy: while the galaxy is physically massive and largely
            reachable, the flow of influence is often one-way. This directional gravity shapes how information cascades
            through the system, moving from influential "super-giants" to the peripheral settlements of the outer
            rim.</p>

                define?</h2>
        </div>

        <p>
            At the early stage of exploring Reddit as a large-scale data galaxy, we initially wanted to perform a
            clustering on subreddits based on embeddings on user overlap, assuming that if
            two “planets” (subreddits) shared a substantial number of active users, they should naturally appear close
            to each other on the social map.

            This assumption, however, quickly revealed two critical technical limitations.
        </p>

        <ul style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
            <li><strong>Structural Isolation:</strong> User overlap reflects shared interests rather than actual
                interaction. Many communities share a large user base yet rarely engage with one another structurally,
                which artificially pulls together what are effectively parallel worlds.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Sparsity &amp; Incompleteness:</strong> This embedding approach covers only a subset of
                communities, leaving large portions of the ecosystem unmapped.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            This realization led us to shift focus from surface-level content similarity to a deeper structural layer:
            the <strong>hyperlink-based interaction network</strong>.
            Each mention in a link represents a concrete point of contact between communities.
            By modeling these links, we wish to construct an inter-community network and identified clusters within it.
            Each cluster is treated as a <strong>“star cluster”</strong>: a group of communities with closely aligned
            norms, topics, and interaction patterns.

            Algorithmic Competition: Identifying the Optimal Gravitational Field
        </h3>

        <p>
            To partition tens of thousands of communities into coherent and analytically meaningful structures, we
            subjected three widely used community detection algorithms to a systematic stress test. Rather than relying
            on a single metric, we evaluated their performance through three complementary, physically inspired
            indicators that capture different aspects of structural quality within the Reddit galaxy.

            <li>
                🔸 <strong>Conductance:</strong> Captures how much interaction “leaks” across cluster boundaries; lower
                values indicate sharper, more stable borders between star systems.
            </li>
            <li>
                🔸 <strong>Coverage:</strong> Indicates the proportion of total interactions in the galaxy that are
                captured by the detected clusters.

        <p>
            While <strong>FastGreedy</strong> achieves the highest modularity score, its optimization favors dense
            internal grouping at the cost of slightly higher boundary leakage. <strong>Infomap</strong>, in contrast,
            fragments the galaxy into over three thousand micro-clusters, producing a structure that is overly granular
            and difficult to interpret at a systemic level.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <strong>Leiden algorithm</strong> offers the most balanced results. With the lowest
            average conductance (0.198), it identifies 85 well-formed clusters that are both cohesive and interpretable,
            while maintaining adequate coverage of overall interactions. This balance between internal coherence and
            boundary clarity makes Leiden the most suitable foundation for modeling the large-scale social structure of
            the Reddit galaxy. Accordingly, we adopt Leiden as the baseline algorithm for defining cluster-level
            dynamics in all subsequent analyses.

        <h3 style="color: var(--accent-purple);">A Two-Stage Classification of Social Distance</h3>

        <p>
            Once this structural map was established, a new challenge emerged:
            how can we precisely describe “social distance” between communities?
            A simple distinction between “within-cluster” and “cross-cluster” interactions is too coarse.
            It cannot explain why some cross-cluster exchanges remain measured and cooperative, while others escalate
            rapidly.
        </p>

        <p>
            To address this, we designed a <strong>two-stage classification framework</strong> that separates
            interactions along two independent dimensions:
            the status of the source community and the intensity of the connection.
        </p>

        <ul style="line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
            <li>
                <strong>Stage 1: Intra-cluster role differentiation</strong><br>
                Based on centrality within each star cluster, communities are classified as <strong>Core</strong> or
                <strong>Periphery</strong>.
                This distinction captures whether a signal originates from a dominant, well-established position or from
                a more marginal one.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Stage 2: Cross-cluster link strength</strong><br>
                For cross-cluster interactions, we compute the median interaction strength and apply a balanced <strong>50/50
                split</strong>.
                Links above the median are classified as <strong>Strong</strong>, representing stable and recurring
                cross-cluster ties;
                those below the median are labeled <strong>Weak</strong>, reflecting infrequent or incidental contact.

<!--        <p>For this reason, we shifted our focus away from the content map and toward a more fundamental layer of the-->

            <span class="rq-label">Research Question 02</span>
            <h2 class="rq-title">How do the social attributes of communication links determine baseline linguistic
                patterns in a peaceful
                context?</h2>
        </div>

        <p>In the previous stage, we conceptualized Reddit as a galaxy of tens of thousands of communities and
            identified four interaction types: <strong>Intra-Core, Intra-Periphery, Cross-Strong, and
                Cross-Weak</strong>.</p>

        <p>In this section, we move beyond describing the structure itself and ask a more focused question:
            <strong>Once major confounding factors are removed, how does social distance shape language use?</strong>
        </p>

        <p>This question seems straightforward but is methodologically delicate. Raw data cannot directly answer it, as
            they are heavily influenced by covariates. Without proper control, any patterns observed might reflect noise
            rather than genuine effects. The goal here is not simply to “discover patterns” but to systematically
            calibrate the data and determine which linguistic differences are truly driven by social distance.</p>

        <div style="background: rgba(0, 195, 255, 0.1); border-left: 4px solid var(--accent-cyan); padding: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0; border-radius: 4px;">
            <h4 style="color: var(--accent-cyan); margin-top: 0;">📋 Core Terminology</h4>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">To ensure analytical clarity, we divide interaction contexts into two
                categories based on the sentiment of links:</p>
            <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">
                <li><strong>Peace:</strong> Interactions classified as <strong>positive</strong> or <strong>neutral</strong>,
                    representing the galaxy’s steady state.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Conflict:</strong> Interactions classified as <strong>negative</strong>,
                    representing periods of instability or disturbance.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>


        <h3 class="sub-glow">First Calibration: Controlling Conflict Rate</h3>
        <p>The first confounding variable is the uneven distribution of conflict across interaction types.</p>
        <p>Conflict is not evenly spread in the Reddit galaxy. Cross-Strong interactions show a much higher frequency of
            antagonistic language than internal community interactions. By contrast, Intra-Core and Intra-Periphery
            interactions are generally more restrained. Analyzing all messages together would allow high-conflict
            language to mask the structural properties of everyday communication.</p>
        <div class="container-wide">
            <div class="chart-wrapper">
                <iframe class="chart-content"
                        src="{{ '/assets/plots/RQ2/conflict.png' | relative_url }}"></iframe>
                <div class="chart-caption">
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>To address this, we divide the corpus into peaceful and conflictual contexts. In this analysis, we focus first on the peaceful context, where language choices
            reliably reflect communicative expectations and audience perception.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-glow">Second Calibration: Controlling Source Clusters</h3>
        <p>Even within peaceful interactions, a second confound exists: the Source Cluster.</p>
        <p>Each cluster in the Reddit galaxy consists of communities with similar topics, norms, and stylistic habits.
            These inherent preferences influence language. Some clusters favor long sentences, abstract concepts, and
            extended reasoning; others prefer short, direct, and pragmatic communication. If a specific interaction type
            is dominated by certain clusters, cluster-specific style could be misattributed to social distance.</p>
        <p>To remove this bias, we apply a <strong>Linear Mixed-Effects Model (LMM)</strong>. Each message’s source
            cluster is treated as a random effect, absorbing cluster-level stylistic differences. The remaining fixed
            effects therefore more reliably reflect the influence of interaction type itself. Effectively, the LMM
            allows us to observe language in the Reddit galaxy after subtracting local cultural coloration.</p>

                After both calibrations, we can treat the Reddit galaxy as operating in a stable state. Language now
                reflects social attributes’ structural influence rather than conflict or cluster culture.

                differential linguistic adaptations across distinct link types</h2>
        </div>

        <p>If the Reddit galaxy under peaceful conditions revealed an elegant equilibrium shaped by stable orbits,
            conflict acts as a sudden gravitational disturbance. Using the LMM model on conflict-context data, we
            observed that antagonism does not merely amplify emotions—it fundamentally reshapes the structure of signals
            across the galaxy.</p>

        <p>We focus on Cross-Strong links—the connections that, even during disputes, attempt to maintain a form of
            “diplomatic stability”—to track how social distance distorts communication under conflict.</p>

            <h2 class="rq-title">Macro Perspective: Steady-State Structures and Conflict-Driven Reorganization in the
                Reddit Galaxy</h2>
        </div>

        <p>Up until now, we’ve explored how different communication links behave at the micro-level, analyzing signal
            complexity, logic, identity markers, and emotional tone. But a galaxy isn’t defined by individual signals
            alone—it is the interplay of all its stars and clusters. At a macro scale, we face a structural question:
            <strong>What fundamentally defines the social architecture of the Reddit galaxy? When conflicts erupt, does
                this architecture remain resilient, or does it collapse and reorganize?</strong></p>

        <p>To address this, we adopt a multi-dimensional LMM coefficient vector framework, which allows us to track the
            stability and divergence of interaction patterns across different social contexts. This framework provides a
            way to map the galaxy’s structural “gravity wells” and observe how they shift under conflict.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-glow">1. Initial Hypothesis: “Mirror-Constant” Structures</h3>
        <p>In the exploratory Phase 0, we observed that the Reddit galaxy is dominated by positive interactions: roughly
            8.35 positive links for every negative one. This led to an intuitive hypothesis:</p>

        <div class="insight-card" style="border-left-color: var(--accent-gold);">
            <p class="insight-text" style="font-size: 1.1rem; font-style: normal;">
                Positive interactions define the social skeleton of the galaxy. They determine who occupies the core,
                who bridges clusters, and who orbits the periphery. Conflicts may add turbulence, but they should not
                fundamentally reshape this skeleton—at most, they change the “color” of the network without altering its
                structure.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>In other words, the galaxy’s structural backbone, formed by the majority of positive links, was expected to
            remain <strong>mirror-constant</strong>, stable across both friendly and adversarial interactions.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-glow">2. Technical Verification: Peace as the Galaxy’s “Anchor”</h3>
        <p>To test this, we compared two perspectives: <strong>Global Perspective</strong> (including all interactions)
            and <strong>Purely Positive Perspective</strong> (filtering out conflicts).</p>

        <div class="info-card" style="background: rgba(0, 243, 255, 0.03); margin-bottom: 2rem;">
            <span class="card-title" style="color: var(--accent-cyan);">Methodology & Observations</span>
            <p class="card-desc">
                We extracted the fixed-effect coefficients for 27 language features, producing high-dimensional behavior
                vectors for each link. Computing Pearson correlation coefficients revealed <strong>near-perfect
                alignment</strong>: peripheral links (Intra-Periphery) demonstrate correlations as high as
                <strong>0.99</strong>.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>This implies that positive interactions are not just dominant in volume—they define the steady-state social
            architecture of the Reddit galaxy. <strong>Peace acts as the galaxy’s gravitational anchor</strong>, holding
            core and peripheral clusters in predictable orbits.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container-text">
        <h3 class="sub-glow">3. Structural Divergence: Conflict-Induced Logic Shifts</h3>
        <p>When we shift to a purely negative perspective, the mirror-constant assumption breaks. Conflict does not
            simply amplify existing patterns—it creates a new social gravity, one that reshapes the galaxy’s
            landscape.</p>

    <div class="container-text">
        <p>Observations show that correlations shrink significantly under conflict. Peripheral regions (Intra-Periphery)
            show the largest divergence, indicating that clusters at the edge of the galaxy are the first to experience
            structural destabilization. <strong>Conflict warps the underlying social skeleton</strong>, producing
